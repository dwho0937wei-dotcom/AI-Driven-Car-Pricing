## Summary Findings

### Business Understanding
  As per the overview, our business objective is to find and understand factors that would make a car more or less expensive.
  
  When putting it into data perspective, the factors are the columns in which we can also call them features and our targeted feature would be the column price.
  Below, we can consider all the non-price columns including the column 'id' not shown in the image as potential factors.

### Data Understanding
  For the Data Understanding, I personally interpret what each column in the dataset represent.

  1. id - the label of the car
  2. region - the region where the car was manufactured (e.g. prescott, chico, little rock, stockton)
  3. price - how much the car cost
  4. year - when the car was manufactured
  5. manufacturer - what car company manufactured the car (e.g. gmc, chevrolet, toyota, ford, etc.)
  6. model - the version of the car (e.g. 96 Suburban, sierra 1500 crew cab slt, etc.)
  7. condition - the current state of the car
  8. cylinders - the amount of cylinders that the car's engine has
  9. fuel - the type of fuel the car relys on to run (e.g. gas, electric, etc.)
  10. odometer - the total distance that the car has run so far
  11. title_status - the legal ownership status of the car (e.g. lien, clean, missing)
  12. transmission - the type of mechanical system responsible for the car's transmission (e.g. manual, automatic, etc.)
  13. VIN - stands for Vehicle Identification Number which serves as a fingerprint for the vehicle
  14. drive - different types of drivetrains in cars that specify the car's wheels that the engine is distributing power to
  15. size - the size of the car (e.g. full-size, mid-size, etc.)
  16. type - the type of car it is (e.g. pickup, truck, bus, van, etc.)
  17. paint_color (e.g. white, blue, red)
  18. state - USA states (e.g. tx, az, ca)

  It's also easy to notice that the dataset has a lot of missing values.

  Here's the sum of null values in each column:

  with the DataFrame's shape (426880, 18) showing that some columns have a significant part of its data missing.
